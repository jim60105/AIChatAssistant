Have you ever been unable to interact with Vtubers on YouTube due to language barriers? Now, we have created a cross-border communication experience for you!

With our new feature, you no longer need to worry about using a translation tool to communicate with Vtubers directly. Real-time translation allows you to easily overcome the challenges of multilingual communication!

Our extension can **transmit YouTube live audio to OpenAI** for **intelligent translation and real-time response**. It automatically sends the previous minute of audio to the Whisper API for speech-to-text conversion, sends the results to OpenAI for content analysis, and **generates five one-click chat suggestion options** to easily overcome communication barriers.

By using our feature, you can easily interact with Vtubers from around the world in the YouTube chat room and enjoy a borderless communication experience!
